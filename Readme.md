#### Github Actions with Docker

In the exercise, we will implement the following.

1. Containerize a GitHub project by integrating a Dockerfile and automatically registering new containers to a Container Registry.

2. Create a simple load test for your application using a load test framework such as locust or loader io and automatically run this test when you push changes to a staging branch.
